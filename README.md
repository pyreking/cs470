## CS470
This is the project directory for my Artificial Intelligence class.

## File listing

``cs470/assignment1.py``:

This program finds a path between two words by changing a letter at every step. Uses the A* algorithm to find the optimal path.

``cs470/assignment2.py``:

This program solves the N-queens problem by implementing the forward checking and AC-3 algorithms.

``cs470/assignment3.py``:

This program computes the conditional probability of an event happening in a Bayesian Network with the rejection sampling and Gibbs sampling algorithms.

``cs470/assignment4_a.py``:

This program builds a machine learning model for a regression problem.

``cs470/assignment4_b.py``:

This program improves upon the machine learning model from ``cs470/assignment4_a.py``.

## User manual
Type ``python cs470/assignment1.py`` to run the first program. Change the assignment number to run the other programs.
